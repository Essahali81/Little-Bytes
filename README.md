# Little-Bytes
Little Bytes is a non-profit in Small Heath teaching kids (5–16) about tech. Through fun, hands-on workshops, we explore coding, AI, robotics, and digital creativity—boosting confidence, curiosity, and skills for the digital world.

I started this project to help share my passion for computing and IT to young people, particularly those who are from less wealthy areas and backgrounds.
